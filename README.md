# All-in-One Study App

The All-in-One Study App is an integrated web application offering a suite of study tools, including a task tracker, note-taking system, timer, and background music player. Crafted from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, each component is meticulously designed to provide a cohesive and efficient platform for managing your study sessions seamlessly.

## Features

- **Task Tracker:** Keep track of your tasks with a simple and intuitive task tracker.
- **Note-Taking System:** Jot down important notes and organize them effectively.
- **Timer:** Use the built-in timer to manage your study sessions efficiently.
- **Background Music Player:** Enjoy background music while you study with the integrated music player.

### Local Storage
Data persistence is achieved using localStorage:
- Task Data: Tasks are stored in the local storage under the key "taskData".
- Note Data: Notes are stored in the local storage under the key "noteData".

This ensures that your tasks and notes are saved even if you close the app or refresh the page.

## Design

### Figma and Color Theory

The app's design was meticulously planned using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create wireframes and mockups. Color theory principles were applied to choose a harmonious color palette that promotes a focused and calm study environment. The colors used in the app aim to enhance usability and create a visually appealing experience.
